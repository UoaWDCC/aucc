          We rely on carpooling to get our members to and from event trip
          locations. Passengers will have to pay a contribution to petrol for
          the driver.
        </li>
        <li>
          The club policy is for passengers to contributeÂ 2 parts passenger cost
          to 1 part driver cost (passenger : driver).
        </li>
        <li>
          eg. for a car with 3 passengers, 1 driver, and a $140 total petrol
          cost; the passengers each pay $40 and the driver pays $20. Ratio
          2:2:2:1, (passenger 40 : passenger 40 : passenger 40 : driver 20)
