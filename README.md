# AUCC Website

Project initiated by WDCC in 2025.

## About

The Auckland University Canoe Club (AUCC) website is a digital platform designed to serve the club's community of paddling enthusiasts.

Our goal is to create a brand new website for the Auckland University Canoe Club that will:

- Provide comprehensive information about the club's history, mission, and activities
- Showcase upcoming events and trips
- Enable member signups
- Feature an intuitive content management system (CMS) for easy site maintenance

This project is being developed by the Web Development and Consulting Club (WDCC) using modern web technologies to deliver a responsive, accessible, and user-friendly experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the project, follow the [**Onboarding Guide**](https://github.com/UoaWDCC/aucc/wiki/Onboarding-Guide) on the AUCC wiki.
